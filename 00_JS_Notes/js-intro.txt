    1. As the function the HTML is to render the Structure of the Web Page/Document, Creating
    new Web Pages and tells the browser how to display them. 
    2. The function/purpose of the CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is to add the style, 
    look and feel the HTML tags. e.g., color, width, height, padding, margin, size etc.
    3. Similarly the purpose of JavaScript is to add the functionality to the Web Pages, and
    those web pages will behave dynamically (performs some specific functionality). We can say
    that the content will change as user interact with that website. There are Thousands of the fucntions that we can add to the websites, but the core purpose is adding functionality.

We Can write JavaScript Code:
    i. Internal JavaScript
        -> We write JavaScript code inside the HTMl Document, inside <body> tag, but we will start writing JavaScript code where our HTML code will end.
        by using <script> JS Code Goes here </script>
    ii. External JavaScript
        -> we have to make a seperate file with ".js" extension and we will write our code. Also, we have to link our js file with html file.
